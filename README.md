# Bike Project

This repository contains the final project for the "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course on Dicoding, focusing on analysis and dashboard creation using the bike sharing dataset. The project involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization techniques. Additionally, a dashboard was created using Streamlit, accessible via the provided link. https://bike-sharingdash.streamlit.app/

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Wrangling**:
   - **Gathering Data**: Collect all the data needed to answer all business questions or problems
   - **Assessing Data**: Assess the quality and structure of the data and identify various problems contained in the data, such as missing values, unstandard values, etc.
   - **Cleaning Data**: Cleaned up the problems (missing values, outliers, etc.) before entering the data analysis stage.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Define Business Questions for Data Exploration**: Create good and effective questions to gain meaningful insight and help us understand a business problem.
   - **Conduct Data Exploration**: Explore statistical parameters more efficiently and scalably

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Create Data Visualizations that Answer Business Questions**: Generate visual representations of data to address the identified business questions.

4. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - **Set up the DataFrame for Dashboard and Populate the Dashboard with Visualizations**: Dashboard as a medium to deliver data analysis results interactively.
